# IT-248-Web-Project (Top 5 Washington University Database)
As an elective course I took IT 248 - Web Fundamentals, which included a group project as the final. We were required to work in groups of five and create a small-medium sized website that displayed user experience design, information architecture, and responsive design. My group decided to make a website featuring the Bachelor of Science degrees offered at the "Top 5" Washington Universities (UW, WSU, WWU, CWU, and EWU) and a searchable database with career and starting salary information. As the group leader, I was responsible for keeping my group on track, submitting all project documents, and completing the majority of the HTML and CSS code, including the responsive design functionality.
